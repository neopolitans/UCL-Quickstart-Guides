# Quick-Start Guide Collection for UCL
**A selection of guides written for University Center Leeds so other students have more resources to get a head-start with a range of topics relating to Programming, Mathematics and everything in between (where possible).**

These guides are provided under the MIT License and are intended for educational use. It is recommended that students refer to these guides as a starting point to the topics provided. I encourage other students to explore and experiment with the topics so that they can find new information and new resources.

Each guide is written and proof-read as soon as possible with a focus on accuracy and simplicity. There may be errors and it would be appreciated if they were reported through the Issues section of this repository.


## Referencing these Guides
University Center Leeds uses Harvard Cite-Them-Right referencing at time of writing. If you find yourself referencing these documents (however that may be), the following notation is suggested but can be customized so long as it follows the format:

```
Doe, J. (2023) Quick-Start [Category]: [Topic]. Available at: [GitHub Link]. (Accessed: DD Month YYYY).
```

Example - Quick-Start C#: Documenting your code with XML.
```
Gilbertson, A. (2023) Quick-Start C#: Documenting your code with XML. Available at: https://github.com/neopolitans/UCL-Quickstart-Guides/blob/main/CSharp/CSharp-Quickstart_Introduction-To-XML.pdf (Accessed: 27 April 2023).
```

If the formatting style changes, your tutors may have already supplied the required resources and you should check your class in Google Classroom (or whichever software takes it's place). Additionally, in this case, please create an issue of 'Incorrect Citation Type' bundled with any updated documentation provided by UC Leeds.
