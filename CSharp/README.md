These C# Guides are not a deep dive into the topic. They are a collection of the must-know points of each topic. Anything too technical about anything here is usually omitted for the sake of the reader. *Seriously, who wants to spend half an hour reading about what the compiler does?* 

What matters is how to use the feature of C# you need, not how it works in the compiler. If you absolutely *must* know how a feature works under-the-hood, `learn.microsoft.com` has really good resources on that matter.

If you find any technical (or grammatical) errors with the guides, please submit an issue in the Issues section. If an issue is about a topic being simplified, it'll be considered based on if it's inaccurate. After all, a simple explanation of a complex topic that you can build up is better than a complex explanation of a complex topic that requires reading more to understand.
